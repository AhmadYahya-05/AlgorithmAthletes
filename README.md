# AlgorithmAthletes
The Algorithm Athletes are comprised of 3 team members: Ahmad Yahya, Sebastian Baiderrama, and Emaad Qazi. All CS students from Laurier, we came together to build a Fitness AI app with an RPG theme system, badges/gamification, Gen AI personal trainer and nutritionist botes, as well as personalized workout recommednations based on data we collect from the user and cross referenced with Kaggle datasets. This was built using MERN, hosted on Vercel and Render.
